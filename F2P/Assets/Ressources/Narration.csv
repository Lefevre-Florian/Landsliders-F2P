Bidoum-A-01;Bidoum: I can't believe we got run out of town like that. What a bunch of ingrates... All this for a lack of food? If that's all it took, I'd should have gone hunting myself! 
Bidoum-A-02;Bidoum: Still... I think it's the perfect time to make our dream come true! To create our own travelling city! The biggest in the world!
Bidoum-A-03;Bidoum: To start with, we need to learn how to move around and change the biomes around us using our Terranite cards. That's the basics for a travelling city. 
Bidoum-B-01;Bidoum: Perfect, you've understood perfectly how to use terranite cards! They're indispensable for survival these days. Now try to get even more of them!
Bidoum-C-01;Bidoum: Whew, that was close! You handled the situation and the volcano very well, congratulations! I have a feeling you're going to be a great mayor...

Narr-A-01;Welcome to the lands of Landorim. 
Narr-A-02;A world where magic is king and the various races that populate this universe lived in perfect harmony. 
Narr-A-03;"That was, until a meteorite made of a material filled with an extremely powerful magic called ""Terranite"". "
Narr-A-04;The appearance of this material completely deregulated the world's ecosystem, making it much more dangerous with the arrival of more recurrent cataclysms. 
Narr-A-05;All these problems led to the abandonment of traditional cities and the creation of itinerant towns, making it much easier for people to avoid danger. 
Narr-A-06;30 years after this event, you and your best friend find yourselves in a rather peculiar situation... 
Guard-A-01;Guard voice: Go away ! You're not welcome here anymore!
